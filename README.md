Teabag
======

So far this is a generic cross platform game engine built with Ogre3D, Bullet Physics, SDL and Raknet. It works on Windows/OSX/Linux. It is built around a entity-component system and uses messaging between components and systems/managers. I aim to build a first person shooter with it that draws inspiration from Halo/Call of Duty/Rainbox Six.
